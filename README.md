# Sample of Collboard module with tool, art, and attributes

Simple sample module for [Collboard.com](https://collboard.com/) created via [@collboard/modules-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@collboard/modules-sdk).

To start work, first `npm install` dependencies and then run `colldev` CLI util:

```bash
# Linux, WSL
colldev

# Windows, PowerShell
npx colldev
```

Colldev will automatically look into the [package.json](./package.json) find **main** entry _(it can be typescript or javascript file)_. And watch, build and serve changes to Collboard in development mode.

Then you open [Collboard in developer mode - dev.collboard.com](https://dev.collboard.com) and there you will see modules that you are working on.

Most of the modules make sense on the board (not the homepage) **so you will probably need to create a new board**.

These modules will be automatically installed & hot reloaded _(uninstalled+installed)_ as you go.

Notice that boards+its contents created under development mode will be automatically erased after some time.
